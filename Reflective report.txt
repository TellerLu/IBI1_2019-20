For this semester, we mainly learned some basic programming language in python and many fundamental knowledge in biomedical informatics. To my perspective, my biggest achievement is a better understanding of bioinformatics and  knowledge about basic language in python. I have learned basic knowledge in classes and practiced a lot in practicals. Whether the practical was challenging or simple, they allowed me to consolidate what I had learned in class, and to practice my skills in finding information and asking questions. Plenties of mistakes were made during the process of practicals and errors often occured. By finding the reason to the errors and correcting the mistakes, my understanding of the use of codes improved and so was my skill of finding and correcting errors. Additionally, the communication between fellow students and the process of helping each other helped everyone to learn better. I realized how important the skill of searching information and asking questions was, and how much communication between students could help. Although my GitKraken worked wrong at the beginning, I finally managed to push my files with the help of my classmate. In the next semester, I hope to maintain the enthusiasm in programming and try to learn more through practice. By solving one problem and another, I may finally succeed in mastering python programing and other useful skills for future study.
